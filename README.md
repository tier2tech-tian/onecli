## What is OneCLI?

OneCLI is an open-source gateway that sits between your AI agents and the services they call. Instead of baking API keys into every agent, you store credentials once in OneCLI and the gateway injects them transparently. Agents never see the secrets.

**Why we built it:** AI agents need to call dozens of APIs, but giving each agent raw credentials is a security risk. OneCLI solves this with a single gateway that handles auth, so you get one place to manage access, rotate keys, and see what every agent is doing.

**How it works:** You store your real API credentials in OneCLI and give your agents placeholder keys (e.g. `FAKE_KEY`). When an agent makes an HTTP call through the gateway, the OneCLI gateway matches the request to the right credentials, swaps the `FAKE_KEY` for the `REAL_KEY`, decrypts them, and injects them into the outbound request. The agent never touches the real secrets. It just makes normal HTTP calls and the gateway handles the swap.

- **[Rust Gateway](apps/gateway)**: fast HTTP gateway that intercepts outbound requests and injects credentials. Agents authenticate with access tokens via `Proxy-Authorization` headers.
- **[Web Dashboard](apps/web)**: Next.js app for managing agents, secrets, and permissions. Provides the API the gateway uses to resolve which credentials to inject for each request.
- **Secret Store**: AES-256-GCM encrypted credential storage. Secrets are decrypted only at request time, matched by host and path patterns, and injected by the gateway as headers or URL query parameters.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to run OneCLI locally:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://onecli.sh/install | sh
```

Or, if you prefer to run it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onecli/onecli.git
cd onecli
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --wait
```

Open **http://localhost:10254**, create an agent, add your secrets, and point your agent's HTTP gateway to `localhost:10255`.

> The Quick Start runs OneCLI in **local mode** (single-user, no login), so no `.env` or `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is required. To enable Google OAuth for multiple users, set `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and the Google credentials (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

## Features

- **Transparent credential injection**: agents make normal HTTP calls, the gateway handles auth
- **Encrypted secret storage**: AES-256-GCM encryption at rest, decrypted only at request time
- **Host & path matching**: route secrets to the right API endpoints with pattern matching
- **Multi-agent support**: each agent gets its own access token with scoped permissions
- **Easy setup**: `curl -fsSL https://onecli.sh/install | sh` starts everything (app + PostgreSQL)
- **Two auth modes**: single-user (no login) for local use, or Google OAuth for teams
- **Rust gateway**: fast, memory-safe HTTP gateway with MITM interception for HTTPS
- **[Vault integration](docs/vault-integration.md)**: connect Bitwarden (or other password managers) for on-demand credential injection without storing secrets on the server

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- **[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev)** (installs Node.js, pnpm, and other tools)
- **Rust** (for the gateway)
- **Docker** (for PostgreSQL)

### Setup

```bash
mise install
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:up          # Start PostgreSQL
pnpm db:migrate     # Apply migrations
pnpm dev
```

Dashboard at **http://localhost:10254**, gateway at **http://localhost:10255**.
